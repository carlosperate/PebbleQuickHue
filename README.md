# PebbleQuickHue
Pebble app to facilitate quick control of a Philips Hue light bulb.

It will toggle the preselected light ON or OFF as soon as the app loads, so it is designed to be registered as a button shortcut for quick light control. Up and down buttons will also change the brightness of the light.
