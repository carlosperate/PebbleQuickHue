# QuickHue for Pebble
Pebble app to facilitate quick control of a Philips Hue light bulb.

It will toggle the preselected light ON or OFF as soon as the app loads, so it is designed to be registered as a button shortcut for quick light control. The Up and down buttons within the app will also change the brightness of the light.
